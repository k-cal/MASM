Most of these programs make use of Kip Irvine's Irvine32 library.

The first project isn't included because it was just some 5-minute program along the lines of

`Hi my name is Albert`

`What's your name?`

The five projects included in this repository are fairly easy to understand by simply trying them out. Projects 2 to 4 are mostly focused on arithmetic. Project 5 is an example of how a higher-level algorithm (merge sort) could be implemented in assembly, and Project 6 is an exercise in parsing user input.
